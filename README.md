# Alexa skill test

This is the initial developement of a sample skill for Alexa, based on the [samples](https://github.com/amzn/alexa-skills-kit-js/tree/master/samples/scoreKeeper) provided by amazn.

The directory structure is broken up as follows:
    * `speechAssets` is the Alexa Speech skills
    * `src` is the code which will be run on an aws lambda server

Set up for launching a skill can be found [here](https://github.com/amzn/alexa-skills-kit-js/tree/master/samples/scoreKeeper).
